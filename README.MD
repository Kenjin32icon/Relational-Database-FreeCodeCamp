# FreecodeCamp Relational Database Course
This is the Relational Database FreeCodeCamp certification courses. I will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, I will learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, I will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, I will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.
